# 👋 Hi, I'm Brielle (@thedataboom)  
### Data Analyst | Cybersecurity Enthusiast | Self-taught Learner

Welcome to my GitHub! This is where I share my journey through data science — from course labs and machine learning projects to real-world applications like interactive dashboards, web scraping, and geospatial analytics. I’m passionate about using data to tell meaningful stories and solve real-world problems.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🎓 Recently completed a Data Science program, with hands-on projects in Python, SQL, and machine learning.
- 💡 I love building end-to-end data science projects—from wrangling messy data to visualizing insights and deploying solutions.
- ♥️ My love language is well-labeled data sets and clean code 😂 
- 🧠 Always exploring new areas: natural language processing, APIs, interactive dashboards, and more.
- 🐶 Fun fact: I enjoy learning new languages (not just SQL 😉). I recently have been refreshing my French and Spanish skills while introducing Korean as a new language.
